# ragdoll

simple CLI retriever for RAG applications (**WIP**)


## manifesto

so recently I've ordered a N100-based server to build a homelab 

as an Obsidian fan, I've wanted to use it for backuping my personal notes   
(and as a bonus, use the notes for a RAG-based personal assistant)

however, resources are scarce on this machine:   
I'll be stuck with an entry-level CPU with 16 GB RAM

this brought me to an idea:

1. most of the available RAG setups are resource-intensive  
   I don't want to waste my RAM on databases or MQs - or disk space on copies of data;
2. there's no need for a full RAG solution   
   tool calling only requires a retriever
3. modular tools are [cool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)  
4. I know how to do RAG well
